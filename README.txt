Welcome to the 7416 Northern Horizons 2020 robot code, written by Eric Norfleet, Nathan Bush, and any new programers we get this year (feel free to add your names!)
This is a stripped down version of 2019's code designed to have core functionality and be easily expandable
It is commented like crazy to asist newcomers and help us avoid the mistakes we made last year.
If you need help understanding something or adding new features please feel free to contact me (Eric) at: 914-441-5122, theericnorfleet@gmail.com, or Regime#8405 on discord
Good luck!
